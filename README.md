# Catch the Stars

A modern, fun HTML5 canvas game where you catch falling stars with a basket — but watch out for bombs!

## Features

* **Smooth, responsive controls** using arrow keys or mouse
* **Dynamic difficulty** — stars fall faster over time
* **Bomb obstacles** — catch one and it’s game over
* Stylish modern design with glowing stars and basket
* Tracks player name, current score, and high score (saved in localStorage)
* Play Again button to restart after game over
* Responsive and easy to run — just open `index.html` in a browser

## How to Play

1. Open the game in a browser.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Use **Left** and **Right** arrow keys (or mouse) to move the basket.
4. **Catch stars** to increase your score.
5. **Avoid bombs** — catching one ends the game instantly.
6. If a star hits the ground, the game ends.
7. After game over, click **Play Again** to restart.

## Setup & Deployment

Simply host the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) on any static web server or GitHub Pages.
