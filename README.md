Dynamic difficulty — stars fall faster over time

Bomb obstacles — catch one and it’s game over

Stylish modern design with glowing stars and basket

Tracks player name, current score, and high score (saved in localStorage)

Play Again button to restart after game over

Responsive and easy to run — just open index.html in a browser

How to Play
Open the game in a browser.
